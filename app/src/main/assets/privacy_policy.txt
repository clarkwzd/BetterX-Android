    The current document outlines the Privacy Policy for the BetterX website (<a href="http://www.betterx.org/">www.betterx.org</a>) and the BetterX android
    app. It describes how we collect, use and protect your information. By downloading and installing BetterX Android you accept the terms and conditions in
    this Privacy Policy and the End-User License Agreement
</p>
<p>
By using BetterX you understand and agree that we are providing a system which automatically collects different types of<strong>anonymous information </strong>from your mobile device. All information is <strong>encrypted</strong> and sent using a    <strong>secure channel</strong> to our data center for processing. The information is accessible <strong>only to the team members</strong> that are listed
    on our website. At any given time, you can request a copy of all of your data via the android app.
</p>
<p>
    The information is processed using various data processing methodologies such as statistical analysis and machine learning. A profile will be created for
    every user which will include his/her usage patterns and the scenarios in which the experience increased, decreased or stayed the same. These profiles will
    be available for your review from the app after a brief period of time. Once the data we've collected for your profile is sufficient and your own user
    model is validated, then the application will automatically attempt to adjust different aspects of your mobile device in an attempt to improve the quality
    of your experience. Changes may include device resource allocations, features that affect content delivery or the content itself. These changes will be
    attempted automatically - an indicator will be shown on your status panel - and their efficiency will be measured.

<h3>
    Unexpected Installation Issues
</h3>
<p>
    In the unlikely event that users/participants experience unexpected outcomes from the usage of the BetterX Android app they can either uninstall the app
    and/or contact us to provide support either via email (at hello@betterx.org) or by using the app's message functionality which is anonymous.
</p>
<p>
    However, given the non-intrusive nature of this project (the app runs on the background), there are no possible adverse effects to participants other than
    the possibility of their mobile device performing poorly due to a bug in our app or a faulty installation. All issues can immediately be resolved by simply
    uninstalling the app and withdrawing from the project.
